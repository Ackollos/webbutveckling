            <h1>Information</h1>
            <p>Ben Tennyson is the main character in the animated series <span>Ben 10</span>. He is a brave, energetic, and sometimes impulsive teenager whose life changes forever when he discovers an alien watch called the Omnitrix. This device allows him to transform into different alien creatures, each with unique powers and abilities. At first, Ben is just an ordinary ten-year-old boy who loves video games, cartoons, and teasing his cousin Gwen. But after finding the <span>Omnitrix</span>, he is forced to take responsibility and fight dangerous villains who want to conquer the world.
            </p>
            <p> 
                Although Ben is often cocky and overconfident, he has a good heart and a strong sense of justice. Throughout the series, he learns to be more mature, to think before acting, and to understand that his powers come with great responsibility. His relationships with Gwen and Grandpa Max help him grow as a person. Ben is a hero who combines humor, courage, and determination, making him easy to relate to. Through his adventures, he develops from a playful kid into a true hero who stands up for what’s right, no matter the danger he faces.
