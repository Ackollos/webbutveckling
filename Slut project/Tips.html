        <h2>Help to realize if you're a Lesbian</h2>
        <p>
            You might relate to this term if you are a woman and you mainly feel romantic or emotional attraction toward other women. You may notice that your crushes, relationships, or long-term feelings tend to be focused on women rather than men. If calling yourself a lesbian feels comfortable and accurate, that can be a sign it fits.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2>Help to realize if you're Gay</h2>
        <p>
            You might identify as gay if you feel attraction mainly toward people of the same gender. For example, a man who feels attracted to other men may use the word gay. If you consistently notice your feelings, crushes, or relationships are with the same gender, this label might feel right.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2>Help to realize if you're Bisexual</h2>
        <p>
            You might be bisexual if you feel attraction toward more than one gender. This does not have to be equal attraction. Some people feel stronger attraction toward one gender but still feel attracted to others as well. If you notice your feelings are not limited to just one gender, bisexual may fit.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2>Help to realize if you're Pansexual</h2>
        <p>
            You might identify as pansexual if gender does not play a major role in who you are attracted to. You may feel that you are drawn to people for who they are rather than their gender identity. If that description feels accurate to you, pansexual could be a term you connect with.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2>Help to realize if you're Asexual</h2>
        <p>
            You might be asexual if you experience little or no sexual attraction to others. Some asexual people still experience romantic attraction, while others may not. If you rarely or never feel sexual attraction and that feels natural to you, asexual might fit.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2>Help to realize if you're Transgender</h2>
        <p>
            You might identify as transgender if your internal sense of your gender does not match the sex you were assigned at birth. You may feel more comfortable being seen and recognized as a different gender. Feeling relief, happiness, or comfort when thinking about living as another gender can sometimes be a sign.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2>Help to realize if you're Non-Binary</h2>
        <p>
            You might be non-binary if you do not feel fully male or fully female. You may feel somewhere in between, outside those categories, or disconnected from traditional gender labels. If neither “male” nor “female” fully describes you, non-binary might feel right.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2>Help if you're questioning yourself</h2>
        <p>
            You might be questioning if you are unsure about your sexual orientation or gender identity. This is completely normal. Many people take time to explore their feelings before choosing a label, and some choose not to use labels at all.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2>Important Reminder</h2>
        <p>
            There is no test you need to pass. Identities are about what feels authentic, comfortable, and true to you. It is okay to take your time, to change labels, or to decide not to use one. What matters most is feeling safe, respected, and supported.
