            <h2>What Is LGBTQ+?</h2>
            <p>
                LGBTQ+ is an umbrella term that includes many different sexual orientations and gender identities. Sexual orientation describes who someone is emotionally, romantically, or physically attracted to. Gender identity describes a person’s internal sense of being male, female, both, neither, or somewhere along a spectrum. These are separate parts of a person’s identity.

            <p>
                It is normal to question or explore your identity. Some people understand who they are early in life, while others take more time. There is no deadline for figuring it out, and it is okay if how you describe yourself changes over time.
